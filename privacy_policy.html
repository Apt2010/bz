<p><i><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</i></p>

<p><i><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></i></p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

<ul class="faqs">
	<li><strong>Consent.&nbsp;</strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about&nbsp;<a name="withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>

	<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>

	<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
	<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
	<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
	<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
	<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
	<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>

<h4 id="DNT"><strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></h4>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
